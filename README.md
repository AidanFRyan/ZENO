# ZENO
A software tool based on Monte Carlo methods, ZENO computes material properties at nanoscale. These properties include: capacitance, electric polarizability tensor, intrinsic conductivity, volume, gyration tensor, hydrodynamic radius, intrinsic viscosity, friction coefficient, diffusion coefficient, sedimentation coefficient, and related quantities. For further details, the documentation can be found [here]().
